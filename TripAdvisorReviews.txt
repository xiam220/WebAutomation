This is the place for excellent breakfast or lunch.  They do all the favorites really well, all very delicious.  A real gem in Weston
We were driving around looking for a breakfast spot someone else recommended and stumbled upon this place. What a great find! The croissants were right out of the oven and to die for. Alfredo I believe was our server and was fantastic. We will be...back soon!More
Had brunch here yesterday and i was impressed with the place, its very well decorated, its inviting.  The food was really homie and delicios.  i had the Chilaquiles with both egg and carnitas and it was delicious.  One friend tried the Benedicts with short rib...and they were also delicious, another tried the Huevos Divorciados and they looked amazing as well.  Overall a great experience.  Service was good, not overwhelming but very good. If you have been looking for a very good real Mexican food for breakfast/lunch this i9s your place.  Met the Owner, Enrique, very nice as well.More
